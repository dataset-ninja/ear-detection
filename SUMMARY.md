**Human Face: Ear Detection** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the general domain. 

The dataset consists of 107 images with 110 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*ear*).

Images in the Ear Detection dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (60 images) and *val* (47 images). The dataset was released in 2022.

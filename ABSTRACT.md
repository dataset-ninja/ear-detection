The **Human Face: Ear Detection** dataset is a comprehensive collection featuring images of human faces intricately annotated to highlight specific *ear* regions. Comprising a total of 440 images, each containing one or more human faces, this dataset serves as a crucial resource for training and developing computer vision models specialized in detecting ears within human facial structures. With applications extending to fields like biometric authentication and surveillance, the dataset's diverse images, sourced from multiple origins, offer varying resolutions and lighting conditions, enhancing its utility in training models to identify and analyze ears across different visual contexts.
